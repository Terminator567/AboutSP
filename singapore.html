            I moved to Singapore when I was 10, Singapore taught me **time management, coding,  
            and that jaywalking is basically a crime**.  
            It was here that I became serious about **tech,  
            debates, and surviving without chewing gum** (a true test of patience).

            This was also where I lost 30kg,  
            proving that diet and exercise actually work (who knew?).  
            This is where my hobbies of **running, cycling, swimming and gym** started.
            I also got into sports such as football and mma, which are activities
            I enjoy.
