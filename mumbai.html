            India is loud, chaotic, and full of food that will both bless and destroy your taste buds.  
            Even though I never lived here, every visit is a crash course in bargaining,  
            dodging traffic, and somehow ending up at a wedding I wasnâ€™t invited to.  
            Itâ€™s also where I learned that no meal is complete without a lecture from an elder.
        </p>
        <p>
            Between street food adventures and intense cricket debates (which I still fake my way through),  
            India has given me a strong appreciation for family, adaptability, and never paying full price for anything.
