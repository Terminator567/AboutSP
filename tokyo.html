        <p>
            Tokyoâ€”land of high-speed trains, vending machines for everything,  
            and my first introduction to the world of tech. Being born
            and growing up here, I naturally picked up a love for coding,  
            problem-solving, and ramen (equally important).

        <p>
            When I wasnâ€™t glued to a screen, I was either cycling through the city,  
            attempting to swim like an Olympic athlete (but failing),  
            or geeking out over bullet trains
