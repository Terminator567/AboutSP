        <p>
            Sydney was where I went full **tech mode**,  
            studying computer science, building websites and miraculously passing all my courses
            while also embracing the **"outdoorsy Aussie lifestyle."**  
            This meant hiking, cycling, and spending way too much time near beaches  
            (still canâ€™t surf, though).
        </p>
        <p>
            If Tokyo taught me efficiency and Singapore taught me structure,  
            Sydney taught me that sometimes you just need to relax and enjoy the sunâ€”  
            while still getting your code to compile. I am now in my second year at UNSW,
            hoping to pass COMP2511.
